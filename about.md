*Hello world!* 

This is Daehyeon Han's reserach blog.

Daehyeon Han received the B.S. degree in Earth science and engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, Republic of Korea, in 2016. He is currently studying for a Ph.D. at UNIST. His research interests include the development of remote sensing and GIS-based​ models for the understanding of the Earth system.

* 2016: B.S. Environmental Science and Engineering, UNIST 
* 2016-current: combined M.S. and Ph.D. course in IRIS lab, UNIST (adviser: Dr. Jungho Im)
