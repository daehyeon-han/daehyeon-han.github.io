### Abstract
Convective clouds result in heavy rainfalls and thunderstorms especially in summer season over the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. Thus, it is crucial to detect convective initiation (CI) before a cloud grows to convective one in the near future. In this study, an aggregated decision trees (ADT) based deterministic CI detection model was developed and validated over Korea using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data collected from 2015 to 2017. The proposed model produces a CI detection result every 10 minutes with a 2 km spatial resolution focusing on clouds that have a high possibility of making precipitation within 2 hours. An automated sample extraction algorithm was applied to effectively build a large dataset using AHI and weather radar data. The combination of brightness temperatures and their differences from 6.2, 7.3, 8.6, 11.2, 12.3 and 13.3Âµm channels make 12 interest fields, which are used as input variables of the ADT model. Majority voting and region growing methods were adopted as post-processing steps to reduce salt-and-pepper noise and make CI cloud pixels into objects. Validation was carried out using different CI cases, resulting in around 70-90% of probability of detection (POD) and 10-40% of false alarm rate (FAR). The averaged lead time is around 40-50 minutes.
