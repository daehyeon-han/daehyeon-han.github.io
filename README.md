Hello, world!

You can access my [GitHub hompage](https://daehyeon-han.github.io)  and send an e-mail to dhan.daehyeon@gmail.com.

I'm a graduate student studying earth science, especially using satellite remote sensing data. My main research topics are:
1) Remote sensing for environmental topics, especially polar and atmospheric fields.
2) The application of machine learning on environmental fields.
3) Development of an operational algorithm real-time satellite data.

As a graduate student, I'm really exited to learn lots of knowledge and skills. Moreover, to meet self-motivated scientists is my big pleasure. This place is to communicate with those who are interested in my research. Please don't hesitate to contact if you have anything to share with me.
